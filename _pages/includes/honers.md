# 🍹Miscellaneous
I'm a recent arrival in London and have fallen in love with the city's sunsets, parks, and ever-changing light. I'm an avid believer that life is a grand experience to be savored, and I'm committed to a life of adventure and joy. If you're in London too, I'd love to share a coffee and explore what this next chapter of my adventure holds.
