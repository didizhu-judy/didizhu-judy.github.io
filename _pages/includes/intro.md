I am currently a Research Associate at Imperial College London, supervised by [Prof. Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/) and [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/), and co-supervised by [Prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and [Prof. Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei).

My research primarily focuses on **alignment and reasoning** in *multimodal large language models and vision-language models*, with earlier work centered on unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in **multi-agent reasoning** within MLLMs, investigating how collaborative interactions among agents can enhance complex reasoning capabilities.
