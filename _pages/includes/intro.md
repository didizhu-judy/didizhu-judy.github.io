I am currently a Research Associate at Imperial College London, supervised by [Prof. Jiankang Deng](https://jiankangdeng.github.io/) and [Prof. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/), and co-supervised by [Prof. Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and [Prof. Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei). Additionally, I was fortunate to collaborate with [Yibing Song](https://ybsong00.github.io/) from the Alibaba DAMO Academy.

My research explores the landscape of **alignment and reasoning** in multimodal LLMs, a trajectory that began with foundational work in domain adaptation and generalization. I am now pursuing the frontier of reasoning, developing methods that empower models to perform complex, multi-faceted, and reliable inference. My overarching goal is to create systems that can not only faithfully understand the world but also reason about it in ways that generalize robustly to novel situations and challenges.

I am always open to collaboration opportunities and welcome discussions with fellow researchers. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my work or see potential for sharing insights. 😊
