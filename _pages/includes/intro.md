I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University supervised by [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). I also supervised by [Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) from Zhejiang University, and collaborated with [Yinchuan Li](https://yinchuanll.github.io/) from Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab.

My research primarily focuses on the generalizability of multimodal large language models and vision-language models, with a prior concentration on unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization.

I am on the job market now and will be graduated in the 2025 summer. I am open to both academic and industrial positions! Please contact me if you have matched positions.
