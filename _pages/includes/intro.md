I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University supervised by [Prof. Chao Wu](https://wuchaozju.github.io/). I also supervised by [Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) and [Fei Wu](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/wufei) from Zhejiang University. 

My research primarily focuses on **the alignment and reasoning enhancement** of *multimodal large language models and vision-language models*, with a prior concentration on unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization. Recently, I have also been particularly interested in **multi-agent systems for reasoning** in MLLMs, exploring how collaborative interactions among agents can enhance reasoning capabilities in complex tasks.

I am on the job market and will graduate in the 2025 summer. I am open to both academic and industrial positions! Please contact me if you have matched positions.
